# Personal Website

Hi there! :D I'm learning how to learn build websites from scratch.

## Purpose

This site is an upgraded version of LinkedIn, showcasing more of my past experiences and personal style. Itâ€™s a hands-on project to deepen my skills and broaden my experience with web development (and take a step away from Python).

## Access
